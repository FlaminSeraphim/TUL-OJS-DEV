    <h2>Dr. Robert Allen</h2>
    <p>
      Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and lived here until age 5 at which time my family moved to Venezuela for 5 years.  Finished high school in Tulsa and graduated from the University of Tulsa with a B.S. in Zoology.  Completed a PhD degree at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN and entered a Post-doctoral fellowship at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, CA for 3.5 years.

      First job (1981) was with the American Red Cross Regional Blood Center in St. Louis, MO as Assistant Scientific Director over the Blood Services Research program.  Became Scientific Director in 1989.  During the time with the American Red Cross, Dr. Allen became interested in variability in DNA and how that could be used for human identification in disputed family relationships and in criminal investigation.  Dr. Allen began to offer his DNA testing services to law enforcement in 1989 and within 1-2 years was conducting forensic DNA testing for all violent crimes investigated and prosecuted for the St. Louis County Police Department. St. Louis County was one of the early metropolitan areas to exploit the use of forensic DNA testing in prosecuting crime.

      Moved back to Tulsa in 1992 as Director of the Human Identification Laboratory at the H.A. Chapman Institute of Medical Genetics at Children’s Medical Center where he remained until 2001.  In 2001 he became an Associate Professor of Forensic Science with the newly formed Forensic Sciences Program of OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine (which soon became OSU-CHS).  He became the Chairman of the School of Forensic Sciences in 2007.

      Dr. Allen has been very active in the field of identity testing, serving on standard setting and proficiency testing committees with accreditation bodies.  He has published over 80 peer reviewed articles and book chapters dealing with human identification and investigation through the use of molecular technologies.  Current research interests revolve around using molecular technology to estimate elapsed time in estimating the time since death and the time since deposition of biological fluids at crime scenes.  In addition, his lab is trying to identify the underlying genetic causes of sudden unexplained death.

    <p>
      Dr. Davis received his BS in biomedical sciences from Oklahoma State University in 1990. He remained at Oklahoma State University until 1994 when he received a MS in zoology. Then in 1998 he earned a PhD in nutrition from Texas Tech University; thereafter, he trained for six years (1998 to 2004) in pharmacology and neuroscience as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. In 2004 Dr. Davis joined the faculty at Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa, OK, where he is currently a Professor of Pharmacology and Director of the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program. He is also a member of the Harold Hamm Diabetes Center. Dr. Davis’s research lab is interested in the role of neuroinflammation and neuroimmune signaling in mood disorders, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and obesity.
